# Continuous-World Rover Control

This is an implementation  of a multi-rover control problem in a continuous domain using deep reinforcement learning.

## Training
The training script is stored in 'runners' as 'run_contworld.py'. To visualize certain results, use the script 'vis_contworld.py' in 'visualization'.

## Requirements
This library requires Python 3 and the packages listed in requirements.txt.

## Dependencies
1. rllab is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, developed by Yan Duan, Xi Chen, Rein Houthooft, John Schulman and Pieter Abbeel at Berkeley and OpenAI (cloned from https://github.com/rll/rllab).

2. rltools is a library that contains helper tools for working with reinforcement learning algorithms, developed by the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (cloned from https://github.com/sisl/rltools).
