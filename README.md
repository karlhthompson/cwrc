# Continuous-World Rover Control

This is an implementation  of a multi-rover control problem in a continuous domain using deep reinforcement learning.

## Training
The training script is stored in `runners` as `run_contworld.py`. To visualize certain results, use the script `vis_contworld.py` in `visualization`.

## Requirements
This library requires Python>=3.5 and the packages listed in requirements.txt.

## Dependencies
1. [rllab](https://github.com/rll/rllab) is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, developed by Yan Duan, Xi Chen, Rein Houthooft, John Schulman and Pieter Abbeel at Berkeley and OpenAI.

2. [rltools](https://github.com/sisl/rltools) is a library that contains helper tools for working with reinforcement learning algorithms, developed by the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory.
